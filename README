This repository contains the source code for the Steamworks VR API. It is 
provided to ease debugging and allow experimentation with new kinds of
hardware. LICENSE.txt contains the license under which this code is 
available, so please read it before using any part of this repository.

WARNING: Although this repository contains a version of steamvr.h you should
not ship compiled against that version of the interface. Backward 
compatability is only guaranteed against versions of steamvr.h that have 
shipped in a Steamworks SDK release.

To build the code open a command prompt to the src directory and run
"devtools\bin\vpc +everything /mksln steamvr". That will create steamvr.sln
that you can open in Visual Studio 2010 to build the whole runtime. Run the
same command on Linux or OSX to build the projects for those platforms.
